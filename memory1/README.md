Multi-model storage engine — unified support for blobs, time-series, documents/graphs, and vector indices.

Tiered storage manager — automated hot/warm/cold tiering, promotion/demotion, and lifecycle policies.

Checkpoint & snapshot service — signed, immutable point-in-time snapshots and incremental checkpoints.

Transaction & consistency layer — transactional APIs with tunable consistency (strong/causal/eventual) per data class.

CRDT / event-log merge engine — deterministic merge primitives and conflict-resolution for distributed reconciliation.

Indexing & query layer — fast point reads, range scans, full-text/semantic search, and vector similarity queries.

Replication, sharding & geo-partitioning — scalable distribution with leader election, durable stores, and geo policies.

Retention, GC & compaction manager — policy-driven retention, delta-compression, compaction, and garbage collection.

Backup/restore & migration fabric — verified backups, cross-cluster restore, tier migrations, and rollback workflows.

Security, provenance & change streams — envelope encryption/KMS, RBAC/audit trails linking reads/writes to seeds/actors, and SDK change-streams for checkpoints and deterministic replays.
